Build from mcl library --> Replace sample/bls_sig.cpp. 
(After build mcl, type "make sample" and then be compiled.)
Output is "bin/bls_sig.exe"

The number of Document: Defined as "define n XXX" as XXX in the line 19. 
The number of Keyword : Defined as "define msgn XXX" as XXX in the line 20. 
(Keyword itself is defined in the line 206 at the main function.) 

Each algorithm is defined as an individual function. 

Note: In Setup, generates are generated in G1 and G2, respectively, because asymmetric pairing is available in the mcl libeary. (This implementation is slightly redundant but no problem for computation.)

The process of main function: 
line 164-177: Define indexes for documents. 

Each function except for Setup and KeyGen in the main function is looping for any index. 
--> by inserting a time evaluation function before/after each function, our experimental result will be reproducible. 

Notice: These code are just for sample implementation. So, communication between a main sever and an aid sever in Adujst and Test algorithms of the original paper is not implemented.
